# Webpage for students at ELTE University to calculate their GPA and Credit Index 

The data about the subjects is taken from the official curriculum of Computer Science BSc: https://csbsc.elte.hu/curriculum/curriculum_new.pdf

## Functionalities of the project: 
### Easy auto-filling:
- after selecting a certain semester, you are shown the semester's subjects for your convenience
- in case you want to take electives or re-take subjects, in the list, there are also the options **_Compulsory Elective_**, **_Full List_**, and **_Elective_** (this is for the subjects out of the curriculum, meaning that you add the details about the subject manually)
- once you select the subject, the credit part is automatically filled since the data about all subjects is stored in the program

### Validation
- you can't add semesters, which have already been added
- for grade field, you can input only the integers from 1 to 5

### Detailed result
- you can get GPA and Credit Index for each semester you chose and in total
